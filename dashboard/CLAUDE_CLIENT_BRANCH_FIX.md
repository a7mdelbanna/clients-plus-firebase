# Client Branch Mismatch Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
Clients created in the appointments page are not showing up in the clients page because of branch filtering differences.

## Root Cause
1. Both pages filter clients by branch ID
2. The appointments page might have a different branch context than the clients page
3. Some clients might be created without a branch ID

## Temporary Fix Applied
The clients page now loads ALL clients without branch filtering, so you can see all clients across all branches.

## Debugging Tools Added

Open the browser console and run these commands to analyze your client data:

### 1. Analyze Client Distribution by Branch
```javascript
// Replace 'your-company-id' with your actual company ID
await window.analyzeClientBranches('your-company-id')
```
This will show:
- Total number of clients
- How many clients are in each branch
- How many clients have no branch assigned

### 2. Get Branch Information
```javascript
await window.getCurrentBranchInfo('your-company-id')
```
This will show all branches in your company.

### 3. Fix Clients Without Branch
```javascript
// This assigns all clients without a branch to the 'main' branch
await window.fixClientsWithoutBranch('your-company-id', 'main')

// Or assign to a specific branch ID
await window.fixClientsWithoutBranch('your-company-id', 'branch-id-here')
```

## Permanent Solution Options

### Option 1: Keep Current Behavior
- Clients page shows ALL clients (current temporary fix)
- Add a branch filter dropdown to let users filter by branch if needed

### Option 2: Fix Branch Consistency
1. Ensure all pages use the same branch context
2. Add branch selector to client creation forms
3. Set a default branch for clients without one

### Option 3: Multi-Branch View
- Show clients from all branches by default
- Add visual indicators showing which branch each client belongs to
- Allow filtering by branch when needed

## Visual Indicators Added
- In the appointment form, clients now show their branch ID in brackets: "Client Name - Phone [branchId]"
- This helps identify which branch each client belongs to
