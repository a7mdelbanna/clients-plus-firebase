# How to Check WhatsApp Messages in Firestore

## The message was successfully "sent" (simulated)!

### To see the message content:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/clients-plus-egypt/firestore

2. **Navigate to**: 
   - `companies` → `[your-company-id]` → `whatsappMessages`

3. **Look for the latest message** - it should have:
   - `status: "sent"`
   - `messageText: "تأكيد الموعد..."` (the formatted message)
   - `to: "+201555282289"` (the test phone number)
   - `type: "appointment_confirmation"`

### What happened:
1. ✅ WhatsApp configuration was loaded
2. ✅ Message was formatted in Arabic
3. ✅ Cloud Function was called successfully
4. ✅ Message was saved to Firestore
5. ✅ Message was marked as "sent"
6. ❌ Actual WhatsApp message was NOT sent (no Twilio integration yet)

### To receive actual WhatsApp messages:

You need to complete the Twilio integration:

1. **Add Twilio credentials** to your WhatsApp settings
2. **Update the Cloud Function** to use Twilio API
3. **Ensure your phone number** is registered in the Twilio Sandbox

### Current Status:
- **System**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Messaging**: ✅ Simulated successfully  
- **Actual WhatsApp**: ❌ Needs Twilio integration

The "Test message sent successfully" means everything is working except the actual WhatsApp sending!
